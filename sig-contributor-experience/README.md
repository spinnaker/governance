# Spinnaker Contributor Experience Special Interest Group (SIG)

The Contributor Experience Special Interest Group (SIG) is responsible for improving the experience of those who contribute upstream to the Spinnaker project. We do this by creating, and maintaining programs and processes that promote community health and reduce project friction while retiring those programs and processes that don't. Being conscientious of our contributor base is critical to scaling the project, growing the ecosystem, and helping the project succeed.

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the Contributor Experience Special Interest Group.
