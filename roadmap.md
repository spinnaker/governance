# Spinnaker OSS Roadmap

This OSS Roadmap outlines high-level deliverables and is broken down into loosely-bound buckets (current, near-term, and incubation), rather than being bucketed by specific release versions.
The deliverables below are a combination of independent contributions from private organizations and a rollup of SIG-specific roadmaps.

In advance of [the 2019 summit](https://www.spinnakersummit.com/), we have also
put together a succinct list of what the major contributors supporting Spinnaker are
[working on in the first half of 2020](h1-2020-roadmap.md).

For Spinnaker Release deliverables, please see [Releases](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/projects?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=is%3Aopen+Release) on GitHub.

## Active Investment

_Themes that are currently under active development or continued iteration._

### Increase Adoption

**Synopsis**: _Reduce on-boarding time and effort to install, configure, and integrate with Spinnaker._

- **Lead**: Armory
- **Beneficiary**: Evaluators, operators, integrators
- **Area of Investment**: Onboarding
- **Deliverables**:
  - Spinnaker Operator for Kubernetes

### Spinnaker-as-a-Platform

**Synopsis**: _Spinnaker was designed with pluggability in mind; indeed, such extensibility has enabled new cloud providers beyond AWS such as Titus and new custom stages._ 
_This process could be made easier by investing in more strongly typed APIs and documentation._

- **Lead**: Netflix
- **Beneficiary**: Spinnaker developers, orgs integrating with Spinnaker
- **Area of Investment**: Development extensibility
- **Deliverables**:
  - Plugin system
  - V3 public API
  - V2 event stream

### Multi-Location Active-Active

**Synoposis**: _Our intent is to run Spinnaker's various services out of multiple datacenters in an active-active fashion so as to provide resilience in the event of a major datacenter outage_.

- **Beneficiary**: Spinnaker operators, Netflix-internal customers
- **Area of Investment**: Infrastructure
- **Deliverables**:
  - Capability of running all services across multiple locations
  - Cross-region data replication & recovery

### Dynamic External Configuration

**Synopsis**: _Today, most configuration changes to Spinnaker requires a redeployment of the affected service(s). We want to enable our services to have more runtime-, externally-defined configurations that can be changed without service deployments._

- **Lead**: Pivotal, Armory
- **Beneficiary**: Spinnaker operators
- **Area of Investment**: Infrastructure
- **Deliverables**:
  - Integration with Spring Config Server
  - Dynamic Kubernetes accounts

  - Improved isolation between accounts and startup time
  - Partially apply manifests

### Amazon ECS

**Synopsis**: _Continued investment in Amazon ECS provider._

- **Lead**: AWS SIG
- **Beneficiary**: Amazon ECS users
