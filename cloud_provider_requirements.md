# Cloud Provider Requirements

The Spinnaker project has an interest in ensuring that cloud provider integrations are of high quality and actively maintained.  In order to achieve this goal, we have established criteria for a new cloud provider integration to be accepted into the project.

In order for an integration to remain in the project, the following conditions must be met:
* The cloud provider integration is actively supported by an organization with a significant stake in the integration
  * This could be the cloud provider itself, or a user of that cloud provider
* Major bugs and issues with the integration are addressed in a timely manner
* The maintainers handle routine maintenance tasks for the integration, such as:
  * Keeping it compatible with updates to the cloud provider itself
  * Making any cloud-provider specific changes in response to global architecture changes in Spinnaker

In order for an integration to be accepted, the organization proposing the integration must agree to provide the support outlined above.  If at any point an integration is no longer being supported as outlined above, it may be removed from the project.
