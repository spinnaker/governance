# Responsibilities

## Description

The Google Cloud SIG is responsible for the creation and maintenance of subprojects & subservices necessary to integrate Google Cloud for the operation and management of Spinnaker on Google Cloud as well as using Google Cloud as a deployment target. This includes things like the App Engine and Compute Engine providers, but explicitly does _not_ include anything related to [Kubernetes, which has its own SIG](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/tree/master/sig-kubernetes).

The Google Cloud SIG also acts as a forum for discussions and feature demos for Spinnaker users on Google Cloud.  It's a place for users and developers to raise their feature requests and support issues.
