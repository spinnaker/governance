The Spinnaker OSS project is run by a group of appointed members who hold specific roles, managed by the technical oversight committee. The steering committee manages the governance structure of the project, revisiting and refining it as needs evolve.

The broader community is organized around a set of special interest groups (SIGs) focused on particular areas of interest.

## Roles

To make clearer to community members how they might progressively get more involved and take more ownership in the project, we define the following appointed roles with their respective duties and qualifications.

Roles are appointed by the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). Roles can be revoked for reasons such as falling out of qualification, inactivity, or for violations of community guidelines.

* Final escalation point for technical guidance
* Review, approve and revoke appointments for Reviewers and Approvers

Election to the TOC requires a majority of the SC.

The TOC will have three, five, or seven members, as deemed appropriate by the Steering Committee. In the event that someone from the TOC leaves during their term, the Steering Committee shall appoint someone to fill the remainder of the term. Each year, the TOC will nominate a member to serve as the Chairperson for that year. The Chair's duties will include calling and runnings meetings, calling votes, and ensuring that meeting notes are recorded.

[Steering Committee membership and meeting information](committee-steering/README.md)

Election to the SC requires a majority of the SC. If a person is up for reelection they are not allowed to vote for their reelection. 

## Special Interest Groups

Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are created as community interest and demand around particular topics become self evident, and continue on as their relevance and needs do. SIGs and their Leads are ratified and green-lit by the Steering Committee via a [SIG proposal process](sig-lifecycle.md).
