The Spinnaker OSS project is run by a group of appointed members who hold specific roles, managed by the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). The TOC manages the governance structure of the project, revisiting and refining it as needs evolve.

The broader community is organized around a set of special interest groups (SIGs) focused on particular areas of interest.

## Roles

To make clearer to community members how they might progressively get more involved and take more ownership in the project, we define the following appointed roles with their respective duties and qualifications.

Roles are appointed by the TOC. Roles can be revoked for reasons such as falling out of qualification, inactivity, or violations of community guidelines.

### SIG Leads

SIG Leads are responsible for the management of a particular Special Interest Group within the project, managing day-to-day operations of their interest scope. If a particular SIG involves altering Spinnaker's codebase, then SIG leads must be active Approvers.

Duties

* Set agenda for, facilitate, and drive SIG meetings
* Review and sponsor proposals related to the SIG
* Triage inbound spinnaker/spinnaker issues related to the SIG
* Review and merge or decline pull requests from the community

### Technical Oversight Committee

The Technical Oversight Committee's responsibility includes the continual shaping of the governance structure to serve the project’s needs best and responsibility for the overall technical management of the project, ultimately managing the day-to-day running of the project.

Duties

* Set governance structure of the project
* Address questions or concerns from the community about project culture, structure, and clarifications of roles, responsibilities, and duties
* Ratify new SIGs
* Set agenda for, facilitate, and drive consensus in the TOC meetings
* Final escalation point for technical guidance
* Review, approve and revoke appointments for Reviewers and Approvers
* Drive technical management and any specific guidelines (e.g. code requirements/conventions, SLA on PR reviews)
* Promote the best interests of the project

Term Requirements

* Nominated and Appointed by Technical Oversight Committee
* 2-year terms, term limit of consecutive 4 years (after, the individual must take at least 1 year off)
* Terms should be staggered, which should result in approximately half of the committee up for election each year

[Technical Oversight Committee membership and meeting information](committee-technical-oversight/README.md)

The TOC will have five, seven members, or nine members as deemed appropriate by the  TOC. In the event that someone from the TOC leaves during their term, the TOC shall appoint someone to fill the remainder of the term. Each year, the TOC will choose a member to serve as the Chairperson for that year. The Chair's duties will include calling and running meetings, calling votes, and ensuring that meeting notes are recorded. 

Inactive members of the committee will be removed from their seats at the discretion of the TOC chair with a majority vote from sitting TOC members unless the member in question would like to voluntarily resign. Inactivity would include but is not limited to the inability to attend multiple meetings and/or the inability to take action items or see them through. 

## Special Interest Groups

Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are created as community interest and demand around particular topics become self evident, and continue on as their relevance and needs do. SIGs and their Leads are ratified and green-lit by the Technical Oversight Committee via a SIG proposal process.
